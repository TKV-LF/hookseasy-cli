. Building Go Binaries for Multiple Platforms
Go makes it easy to cross-compile binaries. Use the GOOS and GOARCH environment variables.

Run the following commands to build for different platforms:

# Linux
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o tunnel-linux-amd64 main.go
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -o tunnel-linux-arm64 main.go

# macOS
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o tunnel-darwin-amd64 main.go
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build -o tunnel-darwin-arm64 main.go

# Windows
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o tunnel-windows-amd64.exe main.go
GOOS=windows GOARCH=arm64 go build -o tunnel-windows-arm64.exe main.go
Store these binaries in a public location (e.g., a GitHub release or your server).

2. Hosting the Binaries
Upload the binaries to a location accessible via HTTP. For example, you can use:

GitHub Releases: Upload binaries to a release for your repository.
Your Server: Use a web server to host the binaries (e.g., https://your-server.com/tunnel-binaries).
3. install.sh Script
This script will:

Detect the user's platform and architecture.
Download the correct binary.
Run the binary with the provided arguments (token and target_url).
Here’s an example install.sh:

#!/bin/bash

# Exit on any error
set -e

# Base URL where binaries are hosted
BASE_URL="https://your-server.com/tunnel-binaries"

# Detect OS and architecture
OS=$(uname | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
ARCH=$(uname -m)

if [[ "$ARCH" == "x86_64" ]]; then
    ARCH="amd64"
elif [[ "$ARCH" == "arm64" || "$ARCH" == "aarch64" ]]; then
    ARCH="arm64"
else
    echo "Unsupported architecture: $ARCH"
    exit 1
fi

# Map Darwin to macOS
if [[ "$OS" == "darwin" ]]; then
    OS="darwin"
elif [[ "$OS" == "linux" ]]; then
    OS="linux"
elif [[ "$OS" == "mingw"* || "$OS" == "cygwin"* ]]; then
    OS="windows"
else
    echo "Unsupported operating system: $OS"
    exit 1
fi

# Construct the binary name
BINARY="tunnel-${OS}-${ARCH}"
if [[ "$OS" == "windows" ]]; then
    BINARY="${BINARY}.exe"
fi

# Download the binary
echo "Downloading the tunnel binary for ${OS}-${ARCH}..."
curl -sSL "${BASE_URL}/${BINARY}" -o "tunnel"
chmod +x tunnel

# Ensure token and target URL are provided
TOKEN=$1
TARGET_URL=$2
if [[ -z "$TOKEN" || -z "$TARGET_URL" ]]; then
    echo "Usage: curl -sSL <install.sh URL> | bash -s <token> <target_url>"
    exit 1
fi

# Run the binary
echo "Running the tunnel..."
./tunnel -token "$TOKEN" -t "$TARGET_URL"
4. Modifications in the Go Program
Instead of hardcoding the token and target URL in the source code, pass them as command-line arguments. Your Go program already supports this using flag.Parse().

5. Example Usage
Host the install.sh file and binaries.
Users can install and run your tunnel like this:
curl -sSL https://your-server.com/install.sh | bash -s <token> <target_url>
6. Extending for Windows
For Windows users, you can provide a install.ps1 script if necessary. This script can:

Download the Windows binary.
Execute it with the required arguments.
Let me know if you'd like a PowerShell version!






You said:
i put it in release, does it correct, it have .zip and a .tar.gz
ChatGPT said:
Yes, hosting the binaries in a GitHub release as .zip and .tar.gz archives is a common and correct way to distribute them. However, your installation script (install.sh) will need to handle downloading and extracting these archives based on the user's platform.

Here's how you can update your install.sh to handle .zip and .tar.gz files:

Updated install.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Exit on any error
set -e

# Base URL of the GitHub release
BASE_URL="https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>/releases/latest/download"

# Detect OS and architecture
OS=$(uname | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
ARCH=$(uname -m)

if [[ "$ARCH" == "x86_64" ]]; then
    ARCH="amd64"
elif [[ "$ARCH" == "arm64" || "$ARCH" == "aarch64" ]]; then
    ARCH="arm64"
else
    echo "Unsupported architecture: $ARCH"
    exit 1
fi

# Map Darwin to macOS
if [[ "$OS" == "darwin" ]]; then
    OS="darwin"
elif [[ "$OS" == "linux" ]]; then
    OS="linux"
elif [[ "$OS" == "mingw"* || "$OS" == "cygwin"* ]]; then
    OS="windows"
else
    echo "Unsupported operating system: $OS"
    exit 1
fi

# Construct the file name
ARCHIVE="tunnel-${OS}-${ARCH}"
if [[ "$OS" == "windows" ]]; then
    ARCHIVE="${ARCHIVE}.zip"
else
    ARCHIVE="${ARCHIVE}.tar.gz"
fi

# Download the archive
echo "Downloading the tunnel binary archive for ${OS}-${ARCH}..."
curl -sSL "${BASE_URL}/${ARCHIVE}" -o "${ARCHIVE}"

# Extract the archive
echo "Extracting the archive..."
if [[ "$ARCHIVE" == *.zip ]]; then
    unzip -o "${ARCHIVE}" -d .
else
    tar -xzf "${ARCHIVE}"
fi

# Clean up
rm -f "${ARCHIVE}"

# Ensure token and target URL are provided
TOKEN=$1
TARGET_URL=$2
if [[ -z "$TOKEN" || -z "$TARGET_URL" ]]; then
    echo "Usage: curl -sSL <install.sh URL> | bash -s <token> <target_url>"
    exit 1
fi

# Ensure the binary is executable
chmod +x tunnel

# Run the binary
echo "Running the tunnel..."
./tunnel -token "$TOKEN" -t "$TARGET_URL"
Key Features of the Script:
File Format Detection:

Detects whether to download .zip (for Windows) or .tar.gz (for Linux/macOS) based on the OS.
Archive Extraction:

Uses unzip for .zip files (Windows).
Uses tar for .tar.gz files (Linux/macOS).
Token and Target URL Handling:

Passes the token and target URL as arguments to the Go binary.
Dynamic Binary Download:

Automatically downloads the correct archive for the user's platform.
Binary Cleanup:

Deletes the downloaded archive after extraction.
Hosting in GitHub Releases:
Upload .tar.gz for Linux/macOS and .zip for Windows in your GitHub Release.
Name your archives clearly (e.g., tunnel-linux-amd64.tar.gz, tunnel-windows-amd64.zip, etc.).
The BASE_URL in the script should point to your GitHub release:
BASE_URL="https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>/releases/latest/download"
Example Usage:
Push the script and binaries to your GitHub release.
Users can run:
curl -sSL https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash -s <token> <target_url>
Notes:
Make sure install.sh is also uploaded to the release or hosted on a public server.
Verify that the binary inside the archive is named tunnel, so the script works as expected.

What to Do Next:
Upload the Binaries:

Build your Go binaries for each platform (linux-amd64, linux-arm64, darwin-amd64, darwin-arm64, windows-amd64.zip, etc.).
Upload them to the releases section of your GitHub repo (TKV-LF/tunnel-client-binaries).
Host the install.sh Script:

Add this script to your GitHub release or host it in the repository’s root.
Test the Installation:

Run:
curl -sSL https://github.com/TKV-LF/tunnel-client-binaries/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash -s <token> <target_url>
